In this repository, there is html code for a recipe website. The code contains links to three self-produced recipe web pages.

In this code, I have demonstrated the basics of foundational html. The code contains a Title for each page. There are both ordered and unordered lists, as well as different size heading fonts. This project also contains embedded images as well as embedded links. I also used <strong> element tags to bolden certain words in text.
